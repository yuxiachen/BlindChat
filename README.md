# BlindChat
app dev group project

Free talk to other people is never easy. 
Imagine if thereâ€™s a platform that gives students opportunities to say how they really feel about classes, homeworks and campus lives. That would be amazing !
Our team got inspired by a popular platform: Blind. 
In Blind, employees would be able to share work-life balance, personal ideas and so on anonymously within the application.
Based on that, we wants to develop a chat room application that provides student freedom to speak out and exchange ideas. The highlight is students can talk anonymously! 
We will keep their true identity as a secret. We care how they think.
